    <p class="fs-5 indent mt-5">I spent several years working as a manual quality assurance tester and lead I returned to school to finish my B.S. in General Studies.  After finishing my degree, I realized I would rather go back to software development, but instead as a programmer; this prompted me to take an immersive fullstack web developer course through CodeWorks in Boise.  While there I practice a variety of skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C#.  I used Vue.js for the frontend and Node.js or .NET for the backend.  The databases used were MongoDB and MySQL.</p>
